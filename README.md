# rmd_templates
An R package housing my rmd templates

Currently, the only supported template is Chicago author date, which is the style I utilize the most often in my department. I will continue updating this package as I begin using more varied formats for paper-writing and employing other document types that work within the RMarkdown/Quarto paradigms.
